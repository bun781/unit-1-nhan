error correction

1 byte:
1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1

the first 1 is the Error parity check, 1 if number of 1s is even, otherwise 0
Python program to add parity bit to a string.
```.py
inputString = input("Insert your number here")
inputArray = [int(bit) for bit in inputString]
parityBit = 0
for bit in inputArray:
    if bit == 1:
        parityBit += 1
print(f"{parityBit%2}{inputString}")
```

Python program to calculate interest rate.
Things learnt:
- f strings
- :.2f magic (count how many decimal place need) ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯
```.py
name = input("Welcome to the compound interest calculator, Enter your name")

print("Hi ", name)
print(f"Hi {name}") #f string

base = int(input("How much money do you have today?"))
age = int(input("Please tell me your age: "))
rate = float(input("Please enter the itnerest rate"))
future_money = base * (1+rate)**age

if future_money > 2*base:
    print(f"When you are {2*age} you will have {future_money:.2f}") #:.2f is 2 decimal place

else:
    print(f"When you are {2*age} you willl have {future_money:.2f}, Now even doubled")
```
