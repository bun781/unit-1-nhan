# Criterion A: Planning
## Problem Definition
My client is an old local bike rental shop owner in Karuizawa. As he puts his bikes in front of his store, he needs a way to lock them to prevent possible theft. To do so, he simply uses a bike lock for each bike. Additionally, to prevent every bike lock being compromised at the same time, he uses a different passcode for every single bike. 

Lately, he has complained tthat he cannot remember all the passcodes anymore, as the number of bikes in his shops ranges into the hundreds, and he feels like he is getting old. He tried to write all the passcodes in a booklet, but soon become paranoid of employees seeing every passcode of every bike, which he believes to be the starting point for a bike heist. Then he tried to use a simple cypher on the passcodes and write them down, but it also posed a challenge for him: the cypher took too long to crack, sometimes he makes a mistake that makes him repeat the entire process again; all of these steps, he said, were too mentally taxing and streessful for him to repeat multiple times during the day.

## Proposed Solution

## Success Criteria
1. The calculator should accept user input to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
1. The calculator can handle typical errors (e.g., division by zero) and give appropriate feedback.
1. If the user enters the secret code ("open123"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
1. In password manager mode, the user should be able to perform CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Update, Delete):
   * Add a password (for example, for a website).
   * View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
1. Save passwords permanently and securely
1. Use the terminal to interact with the user.
