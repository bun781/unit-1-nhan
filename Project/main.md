# Criterion A: Planning
## Problem Definition
My client is an old local bike rental shop owner in Karuizawa. As he puts his bikes in front of his store, he needs a way to lock them to prevent possible theft. To do so, he simply uses a bike lock for each bike. Additionally, to prevent every bike lock being compromised at the same time, he uses a different passcode for every single bike. 

Lately, he has complained tthat he cannot remember all the passcodes anymore, as the number of bikes in his shops ranges into the hundreds, and he feels like he is getting old. He tried to write all the passcodes in a booklet, but soon become paranoid of employees seeing every passcode of every bike, which he believes to be the starting point for a bike heist. Then he tried to use a simple cypher on the passcodes and write them down, but it also posed a challenge for him: the cypher took too long to crack, sometimes he makes a mistake that makes him repeat the entire process again; all of these steps, he said, were too mentally taxing and streessful for him to repeat multiple times during the day.

## Proposed Solution
To make the process easier for my client, I propose a hidden system that allows my client to manage the passcodes for his bikes.

This system will be embedded and disguised as a simple software to search up the rental price of a bicycle through inputting the bikeâ€™s number. However, when the user inputs a secret code, the program will change mode and act as a password manager that allows my client to perform CRUD operations on the passcodes. 

## Success Criteria
#Default Program:
1. The software can receive an input for a bike number and displays that bike's rental rate
2. The software can output the number of available bike rental price information
3. The software can handle typical errors (e.g. entering a bike number that does not exist, entering a string instead of a number, entering floats instead of integers) and give appropriate feedback
4. If the user enters the secret code, determined by the user, the program will change modes and acts as a password manager.
5. If the user enters the secret code ("open123"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.

#Password Manager: 

6. View bike's passcode:
      * User can input the number of one or multiple bikes to check each bike's passcode
      * The user must enter the access code (or words that are potential typos of the access code) to view the bike passcode
7. Update a bike's passcode
8. Create a new bike's passcode
9. Delete a preexising bike's passcode
10. Change the access code while also making the passcode data viewable with the new access code
11. Return back to Default Program or Terminate the Program
12. The bike passcodes and Passcode Manager access code will be stored in a text file. They are also encrypted.

### Data storage
The bike rental rate data is stored as an unencrypted .csv file named bike_price.csv

The bike's passcode data is stored as an encrypted .csv file named watermelon_juice.csv. This name is to detract potential unauthorized users from accessing this file in the first place.

The Passcode Manager access code is not stored, but rather its hash generated by the SHA256 algorithm is stored in a .txt file instead. This is to ensure that unauthorized users has no way of accessing the passcode. This means that even when they are able to access the passcode manager, they cannot decrypt the bike's passcode data, as they are encrypted using the access code.
