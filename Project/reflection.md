# Reflection
1. What challenges did I face?
- I did not know which part to include in my flow diagram
- I did not know which things to include as my success criteria
- Sometimes I suddenly realize a feature would be nice to have and add it without seeing if it was needed or not.
- I do not know which part of my process was important and which part I should focus on.
- Get more sleep

3. What strategies worked this time?
- Note down everything I want to do in the RoT
- Divide code into functions so it is very easy to debug
- My process of making flow diagram was relatively efficient.
   
5. What do I need to do differnet for unit 2?
- Do what the client want. Do not do things without a reason.
- I need better sucess criteria. They need to be measurable, specific, and correspond 1 to 1 to the problem definition. Write success criteria and a problem tackled, one to one.
- Add evidence of consultation (copy of chat, transcription)
- Just parts of the program tht is important
- Test plan has to be step by step, what input, expected output. It is for someone that is not the developer to use. (test, process, expected output)
- Good programming practice is NOT success criteria
- I NEED TO JUSTIFY the tools I used. I can do that by comparing softwares together
- ONLY important bits as flow diagram
